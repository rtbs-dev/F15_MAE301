    "Let the random variable $\\bar{X}$ be the sample mean of zinc concentration. $\\bar{x} = 2.6$, $n = 36$, $\\alpha_1 = 0.05$, $\\alpha_2 = 0.01$, $\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} = \\frac{0.3}{\\sqrt{n}} = 0.05$. The variable $\\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_{\\bar{X}}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}}$ follows a standard normal distribution since $n>30$. Since the population variance (and standard deviation) is known, we have $P(-z_{\\alpha/2} \\leq \\frac{\\bar{X}-\\mu_{\\bar{X}}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{X}}} \\leq z_{\\alpha/2}) = 1 - \\alpha$. Rearrange terms to have $P(\\bar{X}-\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} z_{\\alpha/2} \\leq \\mu_{\\bar{X}} \\leq \\bar{X}+\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} z_{\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha$. For a given sample set, the confidence interval is $[\\bar{x}-\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} z_{\\alpha/2}, \\bar{x}+\\sigma_{\\bar{X}} z_{\\alpha/2}]$. Plug in all numbers to get the confidence interval $[2.6-0.05*1.96, 2.6+0.05*1.96]$ (for $\\alpha_1= 0.05$) and $[2.6-0.05*2.33,2.6+0.05*2.33]$ (for $\\alpha_2= 0.01$).\n",
